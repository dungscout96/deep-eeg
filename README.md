# EEG Feature Transform Models

This repository contains the exploratory work around gaining a better understanding on deep feature transforms and their applicability to EEG. The broad vision of this work can be summarized into 3 core aims:

1. Architecture influence and out-of-distribution data sensitivity to deep model feature transforms.
1. In-distribution data sensitivity to deep model feature transforms.
1. Extracting meaningful unsupervised latent representations.
